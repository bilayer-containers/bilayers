# Install the dependencies for the gradio app
# Note:
# - Gradio depends on pydantic. However, as of 04/03/2025, pydantic version 2.11 introduces a bug that breaks the Gradio app.
# - As a workaround, we pin pydantic to version 2.10.6.
# - If you encounter further issues, consider unpinning pydantic or trying another version.
# For more details, refer to:
#   - https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/issues/10662
#   - https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/10908
