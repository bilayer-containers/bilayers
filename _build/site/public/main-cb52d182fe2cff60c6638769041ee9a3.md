## Creating an Interface for Your Custom Algorithm 

Bilayers allows you to easily create a web interface (using Gradio) or a Jupyter Notebook interface for any deep-learning cell segmentation algorithm by filling out a simple configuration file in YAML format. It’s as simple as filling out a Google Form!
Before you begin, let’s break down the key elements you need to know - 

1. [Interface](/interface)
    What is Gradio?
    What is JupyterNB?
2. [Understanding config.yaml requirements](/inderstanding-config)
    parameters
    display_only
    results
    exec_function
    docker_image
    algorithm_folder_name
    citations
3. [Steps to create your custom Algorithm’s Interfaces](/steps-to-create)
    Step 0: Clone the repo
    Step 1: Create your own Algorithm spec-file
    Step 2: Use the custom Docker Images
    Step 3: Raise the PR → Bilayers Team will approve and can publish the docker-image on docker-hub
