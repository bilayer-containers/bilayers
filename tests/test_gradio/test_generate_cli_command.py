# This file should (maybe in future) test the functional part of the CLI command generation for Gradio Interface.
# Use the test cases file from tests/test_algorithm/correct_validation_config.yaml
# Append more test cases in the same file (if needed)

# Also, if testing individual interfaces, make the folder structure for each interface in the tests folder.
# For example, tests/test_gradio/test_generate_cli_command.py | tests/test_jupyter/test_construct_cli_command.py
